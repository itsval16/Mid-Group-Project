// Reflection -> What I found tricky for this assignment was splitting up the work initially, as we all just kind of went with the flow for
// a little bit and then were able to properly figure things out as we went along. Another tricky part was figuring out how to use the vector
// properly for the transaction history, as in order to constantly add the new transactions we'd have to implement the push_back function. As
// well as having to convert the integers/doubles into strings, after some time I was able to put it all together using a stringstream and
// template function. However, prior to coming across that solution, I was doing some research and came across something new that I learned
// which was a function named 'to_string' that is in the <iomanip> library that automatically converts integers and doubles into strings. IBak
// did not use that solution however, and ended up using the stringstream as I've mentioned earlier.
